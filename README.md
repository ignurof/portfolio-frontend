# portfolio-frontend

This project made me more comfortable writing modern JavaScript and taught me how to take advantage of SASS using the SCSS syntax.

This is a showcase of the frontend for my first attempt at a portfolio website.
All the data gets loaded in from the backend using fetch calls against an api.
Check out the backend here: https://github.com/ignurof/first-nodejs

Here are some preview images of how it looked like in this version of the site.
